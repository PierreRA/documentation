# Generative artificial intelligence (AI)

What is a generative AI?

## Large Language Models

## Retrieval Augmented Generation

It's a machine learning approach that combines the strengths of information retrieval and text generation. In RAG, a model retrieves relevant documents or data from a database and then uses that information to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses or content. This method is particularly useful for tasks that require up-to-date information or specific knowledge that may not be contained within the model's pre-trained data.
